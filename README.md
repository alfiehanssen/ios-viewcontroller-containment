ios-viewcontroller-containment
==============================

A simple `UIViewController containment` implementation of something akin to the standard iOS 7 `UINavigationController` except that it supports:
- gesture-based paging in both directions (tracks touch rather than simply triggers animation on swipe)
- ability to enable/disable wrapping (moving from page 0 to lastIndex and back)
- ability to enable/disable parallax paging
